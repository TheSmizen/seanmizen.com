Git repository for seanmizen.com, personal website used primarily as a resume/portfolio page.
To be used as a portfolio, when enough content has been created.

It's a portfolio for non-web projects - but I'll have to be good at web design too. Very meta.

## Ethos of project build:

-No unduly complex tools or autogenerated code to be implemented.

-Foreign code snippets must be credited in the source.

-JQuery will be used later in the build, node.js is being considered.

## Ethos of project design:

-Every page must be compatible with most browsers. IE is treated as alien, strange, and non-standard.

-Every page must without styles appear as a simple, functional document with text and images.

-Style, animation, and scripting will be basic and resource light.
It should run just as well on a legacy smartphone as a modern i9 workstation.
