		<b>Goodbye 2017, here comes 2018! The world's best metafestival looks in all directions to 2018, expecting the most ambitious lineup yet. With names such as <em>Direct Limit</em>, <em>The Script(){}</em>, and <em>Imaginary Dragons</em> sort of, you know, hanging around and such activities.

		</b><h4>What is NotA Festival?</h4>
		It's Not A Festival. Stuck between reality and a hypothetical reality, NotA Festival is a music and philosophy spectacular which runs every year on the 29th of February (not on Leap Years). It's been posited that NFest is a bit useless, arbitrarily defined, or even non-existent, but proponents would put their their tongues out and make a prrpt noise.
		Nobody's really sure whether it actually happens, but check out this whizz-bang website and decide for yourself.
		<br>You're picturing it, it happened.
		<br>Disclaimers: Please do not consume illicit substances at this festival, or in general. They're bad for you. If you're looking for a fix, I hear Bitcoin is soaring right now, that stuff's super addicting. Candy crush is also better for the environment.
		<br><br>For best enjoyment of the festival, it is reccomended to find a field and lay down, place a towel over your head, and wait.

		<dt>Deterministic NotAGoer</dt>
			<dd>These guys play it by the rules. Entropy, time, even gravity, these all apply to you. You know where you're going (probably forwards in time, round the sun), and nothing phases you.</dd>
		
		<dt>Nondeterministic NotAGoer</dt>
			<dd>Now we're thinking with portals. These guys inhabit time and space in a funky fresh way. Listen to a song backwards? Sure. We'll see you last year!</dd>
